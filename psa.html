    <p>WebGFA will be having a MAJOR update. This update will be a different way for the user system. Sharing passwords will now be your biggest enemy. You will have an account with GFA-Coins. You all start with 100 coins each. 100 coins are worth 1$. The way to play games will now be an auction system, where random games for random times will get put up. You might be able to play Vex 8 for three days or Roblox for 1 hour. All of these game boosters can be traded for others and GFA-Coins. You will also get access to the site for free, with a FEW select games able to play indefinitely (forever without restrictions). Anybody who paid for this service will receive the amount they paid in GFA-Coins. Google will protect your account, so if you want to change your password, you will get an automated email from (alexanderaronov@hwps.net). If you receive an email from any other email address claiming to be WebGFA, please report it to me by sending me an email.</p>
